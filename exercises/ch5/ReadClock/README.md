# PROBLEM STATEMENT 22 AND 23

22. Write a program that teaches children how to read a clock. Input the hour
and minute. Accept only numbers between 0 and 12 for hour and between 0
and 59 for minute. Print out an appropriate error message for an invalid input
value. Draw a clock that looks something like this:
To draw a clock hand, you use the drawLine method of the Graphics class.
23. Extend the application in Exercise 22 by drawing a more realistic, better-
looking clock.
Note: Please refer to the Hints, Tips, & Pitfalls box on p. 258 about putting a
delay in the program so the drawing appears on the window. Also, please
refer to the You Might Want to Know box on p. 259 if you want the drawing
to remain on the window (instead of disappearing when the window is
minimized, for example).
