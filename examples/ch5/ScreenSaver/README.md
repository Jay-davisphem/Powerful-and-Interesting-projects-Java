# Problem Statement

Write an application that simulates a screensaver by drawing various geometric
shapes in different colors. The user has the option of choosing a type (ellipse or
rectangle), color, and movement (stationary, smooth, or random)

## Overall Plan

We will begin with our overall plan for the development.
Letâ€™s begin with the outline of program logic.
We first let the user select the shape, its movement,
and its color and we then start drawing.
We express the program flow as having four tasks:


### Program tasks

1. Get the shape the user wants to draw.
2. Get the color of the chosen shape.
3. Get the type of movement the user wants to use.
4. Start the drawing
